üñ•Ô∏è Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

pip (Python package installer)

Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/breeze-pdf-viewer.git
cd breeze-pdf-viewer

(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.)

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:

pip install customtkinter PyMuPDF Pillow CTkMessagebox

Prepare Icons:
The application uses specific icons for the toolbar and the main application window.

Application Icon (app_icon.ico): Place your main application icon (in .ico format) in the root directory of the project.

Toolbar Icons: Create an icons subdirectory in the root of your project. Inside this folder, place PNG images for light and dark modes (e.g., open_pdf_light.png, open_pdf_dark.png). These should be 32x32 pixels.

Your project structure should look like this:

breeze-pdf-viewer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pdf_viewer_app.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_icon.ico
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ icons/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ open_pdf_light.png
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ open_pdf_dark.png
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ zoom_in_light.png
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ zoom_in_dark.png
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other required icons)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
After setting up, simply run the main Python script:

python pdf_viewer_app.py

üì¶ Building an Executable (Windows)
You can use PyInstaller to create a standalone executable file (.exe) for easier distribution.

Install PyInstaller:

pip install pyinstaller

Build the executable:
Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal and run:

pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --icon=app_icon.ico --add-data "icons;icons" pdf_viewer_app.py

--noconsole: Prevents a console window from appearing when the app runs.

--onefile: Creates a single executable file.

--icon=app_icon.ico: Sets the icon for the generated .exe file.

--add-data "icons;icons": Includes the icons directory within the executable. The first icons is the source path, and the second icons is the destination inside the executable.

Locate the executable:
The executable will be generated in the dist/ directory within your project folder.
